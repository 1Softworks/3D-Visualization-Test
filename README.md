# 3D Visualization Test

A comprehensive test  for validating 3D visualization capabilities in Roblox-like environments.

## Overview

This test verifies various 3D visualization features including:
- Particle effects and emitters
- Dynamic lighting systems
- Trail rendering
- Line drawing capabilities
- Visual effects and animations

## Test Categories

### Particle Systems
Tests particle emission, lifetime, color, and behavior

### Dynamic Lighting
Validates point lights with:
- Variable ranges
- Brightness control
- Color transitions
- Multiple light source handling

### Trail Effects
Verifies trail rendering with:
- Customizable lifetimes
- Length constraints
- Color sequences
- Transparency control
- Width scaling

## Usage

Simply run the script to execute all tests. Results will be displayed showing:
- Total tests passed/failed
- Percentage score
- Visual indicator of overall compatibility

## Output Format

The test results are displayed with emoji indicators:
- üåü Perfect score (100% passed)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial compatibility (some features limited)

## Requirements

- Drawing API support
- Instance creation capabilities
- Basic physics simulation support

## Notes

This test  is designed to validate visualization features in a controlled environment. Some tests may take a few seconds to complete due to visual effect duration requirements.
